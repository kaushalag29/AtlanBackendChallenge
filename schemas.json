# In DynamoDB, we will have two tables -> Question Table & Answer Table
# Question Table -> QuestionId as PrimaryKey & We can add QuestionType as SortKey
# Answer Table -> AnswerId as PrimaryKey & QuestionId as SortKey(Partitioning for quick query of answers for specific question)
# We can have global/local indexes as well for better query of results.
